# Ecosystem-services-Europe
This is the code for my bachelor's thesis: Ecosystem services and ecosystem cover types: An investigation of multifunctionality and trade-offs between ecosystem services in the European Union.

Data for the five ecosystem services used in this project come from the “Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services” (MAES) datasets available from the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC) database (https://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/maes).
